        <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>During filming in Tunisia, nearly everyone in the cast and crew got sick except director Steven Spielberg. It is thought
        that he avoided illness by eating only the food he'd brought with him: a lot of cans of Spaghetti-O's.</p>

        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>While filming the whipping scene, the crew played a practical joke on Harrison Ford. While he was chained to a large
        stone, Barbra Streisand appeared, dressed in a leather dominatrix outfit. She proceeded to whip him, saying "That's for
        Hanover Street (1979), the worst movie I ever saw." She continued whipping him for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope
        (1977), and making all of that money. Carrie Fisher then threw herself in front of Ford to protect him, and Irvin
        Kershner chided director Steven Spielberg. "Is this how you run your movies?" This entire sequence was filmed.</p>

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>For the scene at the Nazi rally in Berlin, where Indiana (Harrison Ford) confronts Elsa (Alison Doody) and steals back
        the diary, Steven Spielberg had all of the extras who did the Nazi salute simultaneously put their other arms behind
        their backs and cross their fingers.</p>
